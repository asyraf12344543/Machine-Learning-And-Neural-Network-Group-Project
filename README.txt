Machine Learning and Neural Networks Project




INSTRUCTION:
* Form a team of maximum 5 people.
* Identify a problem that requires machine learning techniques. Propose at least two machine learning algorithms to solve that problem. Prepare a blog that explains the algorithms used, how they solve the identified problem and provide a review on the suitability of the algorithm. 
* Develop a video to demonstrate your proposed solution. The blog should contain links to the developed video.




OBJECTIVE:
* The main objective of this group project is to provide practice to the students in gathering information, defining problems, critical thinking, creativity, collaboration and teamwork, communication, blog writing and video presentation. The project addresses the following learning objectives: 
* CPS8: Can analyze algorithms as well as design and optimize computing solutions. 
* CPS9: Develop applications using machine learning techniques.
